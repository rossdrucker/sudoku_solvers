# Sudoku Solver

## What is Sudoku?

Sudoku is a puzzle game where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid following the following rules:

- Each row of the grid must contain each digit 1-9 *exactly* one time (that is, no numbers can repeat)

- Each column of the grid must also contain each digit 1-9 *exactly* one time (that is, no numbers in each column can repeat)

- Each 3x3 square of the grid must contain each digit 1-9 *exactly* one time (that is, no numbers can repeat inside each 3x3 square of the grid)

Some digits on the board must be provided at the start of the puzzle, otherwise the player will be able to fill in whichever digits they'd like without constraint at the outset.

Based on the rules oulined above, the game is a logic-based, combinatoric puzzle game.
